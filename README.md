# EventTrackerProject
## Project Description
 Version 1.0
 This is a REST application with basic CRUD functionality. The database behind this project is different chess openings and their attributes.  Implements JavaScript, and through a single page allows the user to search, update, delete, or or create an opening.

Version 2.0
Updated Front-end using Angular while taking advantage of Bootsrap and CSS for a more polished and functional layout. The user can now navigate to separate pages for CRUD functionality via the nav bar. More styling and basic functions in progress.

## Rest Route URI's
-  GET http://localhost:8082/api/index (returns a all of the current chess openings in the database)

- POST http://localhost:8082/api/openings (allows you to create a new opening and add it to the database)

- PUT http://localhost:8082/api/opening/1 (allows you to update an existing opening in the database via the openings ID)

- DELETE http://localhost:8082/api/openings/1 (allow you to delete an existing opening in the database via the openings ID

## TakeAways
This was fantastic practice in building an application from front to back. I feel much more confident with using Angular specifically than I did previously, and really feel like I got a much better idea of just how powerful and dynamic Angular can be.
